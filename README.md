## First screen: Choose Strats
Once you launch the randomizer, the first page will look like this:

This is here to let you choose if you want some scenarios (which require hard strats) to be in the randomizer pool. You can get more info on a tooltip by hovering on each box. They are:
- **Packless**: the randomizer might ban the use of all packs in any level (and ensure you get other gadgets required for a packless route). Some planets are easy to complete packless, so if set to "No", this option stops this from happening on Kerwan, Eudora, Rilgar, Umbris, Orxon 2 and Quartu.
- **ILJ / Sinaflips**: these tricks are available only on some specific planets with special surfaces, and can be hard to perform for a long time. They are usually not required, but for example, if the Heli-Pack is the only gadget allowed on Umbris, you have to Infinite Long Jump (ILJ) from ship to boss. This lets you choose if this situation enters the randomizer pool.
- **Batalia SIs**: without the Grindboots, getting the Gaspar infobot on Batalia requires a hard chain of Slope Intercepts on one of the mountains, and then you must glide along the rail without falling. You can make sure this scenario never happens or have it as a possibility with this option.
- **Tree Skip**: on Orxon 1, you can skip both Clank sections with a very precise jump on a tree, to then punch a pipe and proxy to the Pokitaru infobot. If you want to make sure this is never the only way to beat Orxon 1, you can leave this strat disabled.
- **Oltanis Wall Magneboots**: you can get to the Quartu infobot without PDA or Grindboots and only the Magneboots by continuing to walk on a wall as if it was a magnetic surface. I'm not sure how hard this is but you can choose not to know either disabling this scenario!

If you're a speedrunner, and have run any%, AGB or especially packless, none of these should be a problem, but this is meant for all kinds of players who just want to discover new tricks and routes, and get started with some speed tech too!

If you're not familiar with any tricks or speed tech, I strongly recommend you watch the [Official Movement Guide, by Ricky (ThaRixer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TG2sCofwM), and practise some of the tricks before starting one randomized run!

Before you continue, if you're planning on streaming a randomizer run capturing this window, you can click on this icon <img src="/images/Paint.png" height="17"> to change the background color to magenta to easily chroma-key it. Click again to go back to black.

Once you have decided which scenarios you'll allow, click on **RANDOMIZE!** to let the magic happen. In theory, only completable runs should appear, but don't hesitate to hit me up if something goes wrong.

## Second screen: Randomizer by Planet

The screen should change to something like this:

![Screen2_v1.5](https://i.imgur.com/3fLlVeg.png)

As you can see, all weapons including the wrench and all gadgets are represented by their icons and can be randomized. Even Clank and Giant Clank actions are represented! So what does it all mean?
- For each planet, the weapons and gadgets not available on first visit will be grayed out, and cannot be used even in revisits.
- You can change between planets with the arrow buttons.
- Veldin 1 and Veldin 2 are different, and Orxon 1 and Orxon 2 too, but there is just one Quartu. Keep in mind Kalebo III might not be accessible.
- Some seeds might make some gadgets or weapons unobtainable. The randomizer should know and keep them grayed out past their regular obtention point, and never add them to the pool of possible useable/banned items. If you know of a way to get them when the randomizer marks them as impossible let me know!
- The lit up icons are available items, and from those, on each planet, you are banned from using those that include a frame like this: <img src="/images/banned.png" height="17">
- Remember to hover over any icon to get some extra information on a tooltip!

You have to find a way to reach Veldin 2 and defeat Drek without using any banned or unavailable items! Good luck!
